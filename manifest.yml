description: |
  This app will launch a Jupyter Lab server. This configuration uses
  [Spack](https://spack.io/) to load Jupyter Lab. The app launches outside of a
  container, so it has access to slurm commands, but since the app is running as
  a slurm job, the `srun` command will use the resources of the current job,
  rather than starting a new job. That is, unless you first run an `salloc`
  command to allocate a new interactive session first.
